NASA Asteroids Classification

A potentially hazardous asteroid is with an orbit that can make close approaches to the Earth and is large enough to cause significant regional damage in the event of impact. By Identifying the potential hazardous asteroids, we can assess potential prevent the collision between the Earth and the asteroid. To achieve our goal to classify whether the asteroid is potentially hazardous or non-hazardous, we trained NASA Asteroids data with the Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree. As a result, Decision tree modeling predicted hazardous asteroids with the best performance by achieving 99% accuracy.
